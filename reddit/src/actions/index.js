During the 2000s I was just a kid and watching this team play was always a big part of my life. I remember going to many Kings games, watching this team play with my Dad. It ignited a strong relationship between us. I wanted to write a piece about how this team was formed and the moves they made to become a Western Conference contender and also what brought them back down from a contender to how they became a punchline, years after their appearance in the Western Conference Finals. I will track all of the important moves that the Kings made to reach their contender status. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Richmond Era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off we need to look into the time before the Maloofs bought the team. The early 1990s were not a strong time for the Kings organization. The teams were primarily lead by &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Richmond\"&gt;Mitch Richmond&lt;/a&gt; a high scoring guard who was acquired from the Golden State Warriors for &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Owens\"&gt;Billy Owens&lt;/a&gt; a career role player who never managed to become what was expected of his 3rd pick status, even coming back to Sacramento 5 years later.  This was a move that altered the Kings franchise because Richmond was the first real star the Kings had since moving to Sacramento in 1985. Even with having Richmond the Kings never made much noise outside of a 1996 playoff appearance where they were beaten by the Sonics in 5 games. This was their first playoff appearance in Sacramento. This run captivated the city of Sacramento, but also created expectations for this team in the future. The next two years ended in failure with two straight seasons of missing the playoffs and the ultimate sale of the Kings to the Maloof Family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Maloofs and Petrie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the Kings major years of success the team was lead by witty former player &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Petrie\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geoff Petrie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During his 19 year stint as Kings GM he became known as one of the best talent evaluators in the entire NBA, finding players like &lt;strong&gt;Peja Stojakovic&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Hedo Turkoglu&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gerald Wallace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Isaiah Thomas&lt;/strong&gt; all with mid to late first round picks and second round picks. Petrie was ahead of the curb in the NBA during his early years. He took chances on European players when no one thought they could succeed in the league. Petrie was awarded Executive of the Year twice in 1999 and 2001, both being years the Kings made the playoffs. The Maloofs were a family entertainment group who bought the Kings in 1998. In their early years they poured a good amount of money in the team which led to success. Their reputation in the community was good with the team until their later years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drafting Peja Stojakovic and Signing Vlade Divac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Sacramento selected &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peja_Stojakovi%C4%87\"&gt;Peja Stojaković&lt;/a&gt; with the 14th pick in the 1996 draft, fans and experts alike dismissed the selection as a waste. He was seen as an unathletic Small Forward who could never keep up with, bigger, taller, more athletic, non European players. He made up for his unathletic play by having one of the smoothest shooting strokes of any NBA player in the game. Draft Express says &lt;a href=\"http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Peja-Stojakovic-4489/\"&gt;One of the best shooters the game has to offer. Does most of his damage in that way whether he’s moving off of screens, spotting up, or getting open in transition. Has one of the quickest and purest releases on the planet&lt;/a&gt; Some never even believed that Peja would step foot in the NBA after spending his first two years after being drafted in Greece playing in the Euro League. In the 1998 offseason, Peja finally did decide to come over to the U.S and play with the Kings. The reason behind it was mostly the signing of fellow European big, Vlade Divac. Vlade’s career will probably be most remembered for him being the player traded on draft day for Kobe Bryant, but Vlade had quite a career himself too. During his days in Sacramento he was known as one of best passing bigs in the game. If it wasn’t for the Kings signing Vlade most likely Peja would have never come too. This wasn’t the biggest move of that off-season for the Kings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Webber Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On May 14, 1998, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Webber\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Webber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was traded to the Sacramento Kings for &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Richmond\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitch Richmond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Otis Thorpe&lt;/strong&gt;. This trade was a very confusing trade for the Wizards because Chris Webber was 25 years old when he played his first game as a King and Mitch Richmond was 33 years old when he played his first game as a Wizard. After this move Chris Webber made four All-Star appearances with Sacramento. Mitch Richmond never made it back to the All-Star Game after he was traded to the Wizards and was ultimately replaced by a 40 year old Michael Jordan. Webber had to go after the lock jam at power forward with former college teammate &lt;strong&gt;Juwan Howard&lt;/strong&gt;. The Wizards couldn’t trade Howard because he was only in his 2nd year of his 7 year $105 million dollar contract so Webber had to go. At first he was disappointed to be sent to a small market like Sacramento but he ended up having the best few years of his career.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Williams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petrie took a huge gamble when he used the seventh overall pick of the 1998 draft on &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Williams_(basketball,_born_1975\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Williams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a flashy point guard nicknamed “white chocolate” who was twice kicked out of Florida for drug use. This risk reaped rewards when J-Will was instrumental in putting Sac on the global stage amongst basketball fans. Webber, Divac and Stojakovic all played bigger roles on the basketball court. He made the Kings one of the most exciting teams in the entire NBA. Nobody can forget his amazing plays in a Kings jersey so I will leave you with &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8b0XbtpFsA\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring Adleman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kings were led by new head coach Rick Adelman, and aided by former Princeton head coach Pete Carril, the Kings&amp;#39; Princeton offense impressed others for its quick style and strong ball movement. There system focused on backdoor cuts and good passing from big men, Webber and Divac. Adleman was the former head coach of the Blazers during a good part of the Drexler/Porter era where they advanced to the NBA finals. The hire was described as a great move for the Kings going forward and one that could help them significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Two Seasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In large part, due to to Williams&amp;#39; playmaking and jams by Webber, late-night highlight shows were filled with clips from Kings games. And beneath all the style the Sacramento Kings finished the lockout-shortened season 27-23, the franchise&amp;#39;s first winning record since the 1982-83 Kansas City Kings went 45-37. They were given the nickname the “Greatest Show on Court” like the St.Louis Rams of the NFL. Both were small market teams which had exciting lineups that were stealing the show in the NBA. Adleman’s system worked perfectly but unfortunately the Kings were still unable to make it past the first round where they got taken down by the Utah Jazz with Malone and Stockton. Webber was named to the All-NBA Second Team and Jason Williams was an All Rookie First teamer. In their 15th year in Sacremento they finished with a record of 44-38 overall finishing fifth in the Pacific Division and securing the eighth seed in the Western Conference Playoffs. The Kings forced the eventual NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers to a fifth game in the opening round of the playoffs. This was just the first meeting of these two rivals who would meet multiple times in the future. The problem with the Kings was that they had a horrendous defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christie Trade and the 55 win season&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kings traded starting small forward &lt;strong&gt;Corliss Williamson&lt;/strong&gt; to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Christie_(basketball\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doug Christie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a move made to improve the subpar defense. Christie immediately improved the defense gaining a second-team All Defense in his first year there. More importantly trading Williamson the starting small forward at the time freed up room for Peja Stojakovic who that season finished second in voting for the Most Improved Player Award. They also drafted Turkish power forward Hedo Turkoglu and Guard Bobby “Action Jackson” Jackson , further improving their bench rotation. This not only gave them one of the best starting lineups in the league but one of the strongest benches too. They were heavily represented during the all-star break with. Sacramento Head Coach Rick Adelman and his coaching staff manned the Western Conference All-Star bench as a result of the Kings owning the Western Conference&amp;#39;s best record at the All-Star break. Sacramento forward Chris Webber was named as a starter for the first time in his career, while Kings center Vlade Divac made his All-Star Game debut, having been selected to the -team as a reserve. The Kings had arguably their best year in franchise history finishing the year 55-27 and winning their first playoff series in Sacramento. The Kings beat the Suns in 4 games before once again losing to the Lakers this year in a sweep. Nonetheless the Kings were on the right track but they had one more move to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mike Bibby for Jason Williams Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In July 2001, the Kings made franchise altering move. They traded flashy point guard &lt;strong&gt;Jason Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, along with Nick Anderson, to the Vancouver Grizzlies for Mike Bibby and Brent Price. The Kings felt done with Jason Williams’s turnovers, poor shot choices and lack of defensive effort. This often led to be spending time on the bench for the Kings and because of this, Coach Adelman routinely sat Williams during the 4th quarters of games and other clutch moments. Petrie thought Williams’ skills were outweighed by his erratic behavior and lack of improvement. Because of this, Coach Adelman routinely sat Williams during the 4th quarters of games and other clutch moments. This was one of the most important trades in Kings franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Peak Season&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2001-02, the Sacramento Kings enjoyed its best season in franchise history, finishing the regular season with the best record in the NBA at 61-21, assuring the Kings the home court advantage throughout the playoffs. The addition of Bibby proved to have taken them to a new level. Bibby was far more consistent than Jason Williams and thus fit in better with Webber and Stojakovic. The main reason of the team’s drastic improvement was the duo of Webber and Stojakovic. That season Webber and Stojakovic teamed to form one of the most potent tandems in the NBA. The Kings were 43-8 when Stojakovic scored 20 or more points and 32-9 when Webber tallied 20 or more. Statistically, Sacramento finished in the league’s top five in several categories, including defensive rebounding (1st), scoring (2nd), rebounding (2nd), steals (3rd), field goal percentage (2nd), and assists (4th). The Kings were 44- 7 when scoring 100 points or more. The only other team to reach 100 points more times than Sacramento this year was Dallas. Webber established himself as an MVP candidate, Christie was once again an All-defensive player, Bobby Jackson a sixth man of the year candidate and Rick Adleman narrowly missing out on coach of the year. With all these the Kings came into the playoffs as favorites to win the title. The East was weaker than most years but they still had to get past the Lakers. After defeating their first two playoff matchups against the Stockton and Malone-led Jazz and the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, respectively, the Kings went on to play their archrival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, which later would be regarded as one of the greatest playoff matchups in history and also one of the biggest title robberies ever in NBA history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2002 Western Conference Finals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first two games of the series were split right down the middle between the Lakers and the Kings. Game 3 was dominated by the Kings at Staples, despite a 20 point 19 rebound game by Shaq and Game 4 was won by the Lakers on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYQDsZljAOY\"&gt;this…&lt;/a&gt;. There it shifted to Game 5 when it was up to the Kings to hit a clutch shot and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZRxCUfpGWI\"&gt;Mike Bibby produced&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why he was traded for White Chocolate. Game 6 is considered to be one of the most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; sports columnist Michael Wilbon responded to the calls in Game 6: &amp;quot;I wrote down in my notebook six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship.&amp;quot; He said “On the other hand, Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the nose in plain view with the Lakers up by one, but no foul was called on Kobe, even though Bibby lay on the court and then went to the sideline bleeding.” In game 7 the Lakers ended up winning 112-106 with Shaq scoring a total of 41 points and winning the series for LA. The series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee Tim Donaghy&amp;#39;s attorney filed a court document alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy &amp;quot;learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be &amp;#39;company men&amp;#39;, always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA&amp;#39;s interest to add another game to the series.&amp;quot; The Lakers won Game 6 106-102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a Kings fan I cannot stress how much I believe that this whole series was made for the Lakers to eventually win it. Had the Kings won that game they would have easily ran past the Nets in the finals. This led to the demise of this special team. David Stern will forever have to live with the controversy of this finals series. I&amp;#39;m really hoping that something like this will never happen in the current NBA. Nonetheless this was a special Kings team. They were amazing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2 on the Kings fall will be coming tomorrow. I thought this was enough writing for today. Tell me if you want me to continue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m going to write it a day when the playoffs are not very intense.

The hire was described as a great move for the Kings going forward and one that could help them significantly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Next Two Seasons.**\n\nIn large part, due to to Williams' playmaking and jams by Webber, late-night highlight shows were filled with clips from Kings games. And beneath all the style the Sacramento Kings finished the lockout-shortened season 27-23, the franchise's first winning record since the 1982-83 Kansas City Kings went 45-37. They were given the nickname the “Greatest Show on Court” like the St.Louis Rams of the NFL. Both were small market teams which had exciting lineups that were stealing the show in the NBA. Adleman’s system worked perfectly but unfortunately the Kings were still unable to make it past the first round where they got taken down by the Utah Jazz with Malone and Stockton. Webber was named to the All-NBA Second Team and Jason Williams was an All Rookie First teamer. In their 15th year in Sacremento they finished with a record of 44-38 overall finishing fifth in the Pacific Division and securing the eighth seed in the Western Conference Playoffs. The Kings forced the eventual NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers to a fifth game in the opening round of the playoffs. This was just the first meeting of these two rivals who would meet multiple times in the future. The problem with the Kings was that they had a horrendous defense.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Christie Trade and the 55 win season**\n\nThe Kings traded starting small forward **Corliss Williamson** to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard [**Doug Christie**]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Christie_(basketball), a move made to improve the subpar defense. Christie immediately improved the defense gaining a second-team All Defense in his first year there. More importantly trading Williamson the starting small forward at the time freed up room for Peja Stojakovic who that season finished second in voting for the Most Improved Player Award. They also drafted Turkish power forward Hedo Turkoglu and Guard Bobby “Action Jackson” Jackson , further improving their bench rotation. This not only gave them one of the best starting lineups in the league but one of the strongest benches too. They were heavily represented during the all-star break with. Sacramento Head Coach Rick Adelman and his coaching staff manned the Western Conference All-Star bench as a result of the Kings owning the Western Conference's best record at the All-Star break. Sacramento forward Chris Webber was named as a starter for the first time in his career, while Kings center Vlade Divac made his All-Star Game debut, having been selected to the -team as a reserve. The Kings had arguably their best year in franchise history finishing the year 55-27 and winning their first playoff series in Sacramento. The Kings beat the Suns in 4 games before once again losing to the Lakers this year in a sweep. Nonetheless the Kings were on the right track but they had one more move to make.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**The Mike Bibby for Jason Williams Trade**\n\nIn July 2001, the Kings made franchise altering move. They traded flashy point guard **Jason Williams**, along with Nick Anderson, to the Vancouver Grizzlies for Mike Bibby and Brent Price. The Kings felt done with Jason Williams’s turnovers, poor shot choices and lack of defensive effort. This often led to be spending time on the bench for the Kings and because of this, Coach Adelman routinely sat Williams during the 4th quarters of games and other clutch moments. Petrie thought Williams’ skills were outweighed by his erratic behavior and lack of improvement. Because of this, Coach Adelman routinely sat Williams during the 4th quarters of games and other clutch moments. This was one of the most important trades in Kings franchise history.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**The Peak Season**\n\nIn 2001-02, the Sacramento Kings enjoyed its best season in franchise history, finishing the regular season with the best record in the NBA at 61-21, assuring the Kings the home court advantage throughout the playoffs. The addition of Bibby proved to have taken them to a new level. Bibby was far more consistent than Jason Williams and thus fit in better with Webber and Stojakovic. The main reason of the team’s drastic improvement was the duo of Webber and Stojakovic. That season Webber and Stojakovic teamed to form one of the most potent tandems in the NBA. The Kings were 43-8 when Stojakovic scored 20 or more points and 32-9 when Webber tallied 20 or more. Statistically, Sacramento finished in the league’s top five in several categories, including defensive rebounding (1st), scoring (2nd), rebounding (2nd), steals (3rd), field goal percentage (2nd), and assists (4th). The Kings were 44- 7 when scoring 100 points or more. The only other team to reach 100 points more times than Sacramento this year was Dallas. Webber established himself as an MVP candidate, Christie was once again an All-defensive player, Bobby Jackson a sixth man of the year candidate and Rick Adleman narrowly missing out on coach of the year. With all these the Kings came into the playoffs as favorites to win the title. The East was weaker than most years but they still had to get past the Lakers. After defeating their first two playoff matchups against the Stockton and Malone-led Jazz and the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, respectively, the Kings went on to play their archrival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, which later would be regarded as one of the greatest playoff matchups in history and also one of the biggest title robberies ever in NBA history.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**2002 Western Conference Finals**\n\nThe first two games of the series were split right down the middle between the Lakers and the Kings. Game 3 was dominated by the Kings at Staples, despite a 20 point 19 rebound game by Shaq and Game 4 was won by the Lakers on [this…]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYQDsZljAOY). There it shifted to Game 5 when it was up to the Kings to hit a clutch shot and [Mike Bibby produced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZRxCUfpGWI). That’s why he was traded for White Chocolate. Game 6 is considered to be one of the most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The *Washington Post* sports columnist Michael Wilbon responded to the calls in Game 6: \"I wrote down in my notebook six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship.\" He said “On the other hand, Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the nose in plain view with the Lakers up by one, but no foul was called on Kobe, even though Bibby lay on the court and then went to the sideline bleeding.” In game 7 the Lakers ended up winning 112-106 with Shaq scoring a total of 41 points and winning the series for LA. The series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee Tim Donaghy's attorney filed a court document alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy \"learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series.\" The Lakers won Game 6 106-102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs a Kings fan I cannot stress how much I believe that this whole series was made for the Lakers to eventually win it. Had the Kings won that game they would have easily ran past the Nets in the finals. This led to the demise of this special team. David Stern will forever have to live with the controversy of this finals series. I'm really hoping that something like this will never happen in the current NBA. Nonetheless this was a special Kings team. They were amazing. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Part 2 on the Kings fall will be coming tomorrow. I thought this was enough writing for today. Tell me if you want me to continue**\n\nEdit: I'm going to write it a day when the playoffs are not very intense. If you want it tommorow tell me.
